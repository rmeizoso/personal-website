On my free time, I enjoy exercising, eating out, cooking and playing video games (in particular <a href = 'https://www.ssbwiki.com/Super_Smash_Bros._Ultimate'>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a>, in which I have made it into the <a href='https://www.ssbwiki.com/Elite_Smash'>Elite Smash</a>, an achievement I am proud of). Being born in the caribbean, I try to spend as much time as possible in the beach or finding my way to one  (although I unfortunately don't get to do that in Atlanta). I also enjoy listening to music, most notably rock (<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustavo_Cerati'>Gustavo Cerati</a>, the best hispanic rockstar of all time), pop rock (<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mayer'>John Mayer</a>), and reggaeton (<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Bunny'>Bad Bunny</a>).
