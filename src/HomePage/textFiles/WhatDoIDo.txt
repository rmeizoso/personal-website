I am a Graduate Student at <a href='https://www.cc.gatech.edu/'>Georgia Tech's College of Computing</a>, where I am working towards my Master's Degree in Computer Science with a Specialization in Machine Learning with an expected Graduation Date of December 2021. Recently, I started conducting reasearch in Georgia Tech's <a href='http://gritslab.gatech.edu/home/'>GRITSLab</a> advised by Dr. <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_Egerstedt'>Magnus Egerstedt</a>. My research interests lie in the intersection of Robotics, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning'>Machine Learning</a>, and  <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory'>Control Theory</a>, with the latter being a field that I have recently grown fond of. During the summer, I am usually working on hands on, real world programming projects, as you can see in the <a href='/CV'>CV</a> section.
